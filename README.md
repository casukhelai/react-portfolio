## Description
This application is meant to be my portfolio, made completely through React! It has a tab to direct to my About Me section, my Contact Me form, a download button for my Resume, and a section for my Portfolio. 

The React portfolio proved to be difficult, especially the way each file is linked to each other and when to use certain syntax.

## Installation
1. Clone this repo using
``` git clone git@github.com:casukhelai/react-portfolio.git ```
2. Install dependencies using: 
``` npm i ```
*** Note *** The github pages is not deploying because there is an error in my app. This error is being further investigated.
